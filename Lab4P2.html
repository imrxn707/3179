<!-- A. Understanding the structure of HTML -->

<!-- 
● !Doctype element lets the browser know that this document should be processed as an HTML document.
● Html element is the root of an HTML document. It will have two children elements nested in it (head and body element)
● Head element will be used to link your CSS and JS files to the HTML document and to give a title for this web page.
● Body element is the container for all your visible content, such as images, videos or textual content.
